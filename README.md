# EKSphemeral: The EKS Ephemeral Cluster Manager

> This is a service for development and test environments.
> It is not an official AWS offering, use at your own risk.

EKSphemeral is a simple manager for ephemeral EKS clusters, allowing you to
launch EKS clusters that auto-tear down after some time, and you can also prolong their lifetime if you want to continue to use them.
